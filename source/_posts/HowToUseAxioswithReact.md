### Introduction

Many projects on the web need to interface with a REST API at some stage in their development. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is a lightweight HTTP client based on the `$http` service within Angular.js v1.x and is similar to the native JavaScript [Fetch API](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-fetch-api).

Axios is promise-based, which gives you the ability to take advantage of JavaScript’s `async` and `await` for more readable asynchronous code.

You can also intercept and cancel requests, and there’s built-in client-side protection against cross-site request forgery.

In this article, you will see examples of how to use Axios to access the popular [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API within a React application.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this article, you’ll need the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10.16.0 installed on your computer. To install this on macOS or Ubuntu 18.04, follow the steps in [How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment on macOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment-on-macos) or the **Installing Using a PPA** section of [How To Install Node.js on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04).
- A new React project set up with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by following the [How to Set up a React Project with Create React App](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-react-project-with-create-react-app) tutorial.
- It will also help to have a basic understanding of JavaScript, which you can find in the [How To Code in JavaScript series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript), along with a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## Step 1 — Adding Axios to the Project

In this section, you will add Axios to the `digital-ocean-tutorial` React project you created following the [How to Set up a React Project with Create React App](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-react-project-with-create-react-app) tutorial.

To add Axios to the project, open your terminal and change directories into your project:

```bash
cd digital-ocean-tutorial
```



Then run this command to install Axios:

```bash
npm install axios
```



Next, you will need to import Axios into the file you want to use it in.

## Step 2 — Making a `GET` Request

In this example, you create a new component and import Axios into it to send a `GET` request.

Inside the `src` folder of your React project, create a new component named `PersonList.js`:

```bash
nano src/PersonList.js
```



Add the following code to the component:

digital-ocean-tutorial/src/PersonList.js

```js
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

export default class PersonList extends React.Component {
  state = {
    persons: []
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`)
      .then(res => {
        const persons = res.data;
        this.setState({ persons });
      })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        { this.state.persons.map(person => <li>{person.name}</li>)}
      </ul>
    )
  }
}
```



First, you import React and Axios so that both can be used in the component. Then you hook into the `componentDidMount` lifecycle hook and perform a `GET` request.

You use `axios.get(url)` with a URL from an API endpoint to get a promise which returns a response object. Inside the response object, there is data that is then assigned the value of `person`.

You can also get other information about the request, such as the status code under `res.status` or more information inside of `res.request`.

## Step 3 — Making a `POST` Request

In this step, you will use Axios with another HTTP request method called `POST`.

Remove the previous code in `PersonList` and add the following to create a form that allows for user input and subsequently `POST`s the content to an API:

digital-ocean-tutorial/src/PersonList.js

```js
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

export default class PersonList extends React.Component {
  state = {
    name: '',
  }

  handleChange = event => {
    this.setState({ name: event.target.value });
  }

  handleSubmit = event => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const user = {
      name: this.state.name
    };

    axios.post(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`, { user })
      .then(res => {
        console.log(res);
        console.log(res.data);
      })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <label>
            Person Name:
            <input type="text" name="name" onChange={this.handleChange} />
          </label>
          <button type="submit">Add</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

 

Inside the `handleSubmit` function, you prevent the default action of the form. Then update the `state` to the `user` input.

Using `POST` gives you the same response object with information that you can use inside of a `then` call.

To complete the `POST` request, you first capture the `user` input. Then you add the input along with the `POST` request, which will give you a response. You can then `console.log` the response, which should show the `user` input in the form.

## Step 4 — Making a `DELETE` Request

In this example, you will see how to delete items from an API using `axios.delete` and passing a URL as a parameter.

Change the code for the form from the `POST` example to delete a user instead of adding a new one:

digital-ocean-tutorial/src/PersonList.js

```js
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

export default class PersonList extends React.Component {
  state = {
    id: '',
  }

  handleChange = event => {
    this.setState({ id: event.target.value });
  }

  handleSubmit = event => {
    event.preventDefault();

    axios.delete(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${this.state.id}`)
      .then(res => {
        console.log(res);
        console.log(res.data);
      })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <label>
            Person ID:
            <input type="text" name="id" onChange={this.handleChange} />
          </label>
          <button type="submit">Delete</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```



Again, the `res` object provides you with information about the request. You can then `console.log` that information again after the form is submitted.

## Step 5 — Using a Base Instance in Axios

In this example, you will see how you can set up a _base instance_ in which you can define a URL and any other configuration elements.

Create a separate file named `api.js`:

```bash
nano src/api.js
```



Export a new `axios` instance with these defaults:

digital-ocean-tutorial/src/api.js

```js
import axios from 'axios';

export default axios.create({
  baseURL: `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`
});
```



Once the default instance is set up, it can then be used inside of the `PersonList` component. You import the new instance like this:

digital-ocean-tutorial/src/PersonList.js

```js
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

import API from '../api';

export default class PersonList extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit = event => {
    event.preventDefault();

    API.delete(`users/${this.state.id}`)
      .then(res => {
        console.log(res);
        console.log(res.data);
      })
  }
}
```



Because `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/` is now the base URL, you no longer need to type out the whole URL each time you want to hit a different endpoint on the API.

## Step 6 — Using `async` and `await`

In this example, you will see how you can use `async` and `await` to work with promises.

The `await` keyword resolves the `promise` and returns the `value`. The `value` can then be assigned to a variable.

```js
handleSubmit = async event => {
  event.preventDefault();

  //
  const response = await API.delete(`users/${this.state.id}`);

  console.log(response);
  console.log(response.data);
};
```



In this code sample, the `.then()` is replaced. The `promise` is resolved, and the value is stored inside the `response` variable.

In this tutorial, you explored several examples on how to use Axios inside a React application to create HTTP requests and handle responses.
